## 🎯 Slide 4: What Is Generative AI?

**AI that creates — text, images, code, and more. The brain behind ChatGPT and beyond.**

### What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can create new content, rather than just analyzing existing data. Think of it as AI that can "imagine" and "create."

### Types of Generative AI:
- **Text Generation**: ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude
- **Image Generation**: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion
- **Code Generation**: GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI

### How It Works:
1. **Training**: AI learns from massive datasets
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns in the data
3. **Generation**: Creates new content based on learned patterns
4. **Refinement**: Improves output through feedback

### Real Example:
```
Input: "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
Output: 
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

- Missing dependencies
- Version conflicts

#### 📦 **Docker Solution**
- Package everything together
- Run consistently everywhere
- Isolated environments
- Version control for environments
- Easy deployment

### Docker Benefits:

#### 🚀 **Portability**
- Run on any computer with Docker
- No need to install dependencies
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- Cloud deployment ready

#### 🔒 **Isolation**
- Each app runs in its own container
- No conflicts between applications
- Secure and isolated environments
- Easy to manage multiple apps

#### ⚡ **Speed**
- Start containers in seconds
- No need to install software
- Consistent performance
- Quick development cycles

#### 📈 **Scalability**
- Run multiple instances easily
- Load balancing across containers
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Resource optimization

### Docker vs Traditional Deployment:

#### Traditional Way:
```
1. Install operating system
2. Install programming language
3. Install framework
4. Install dependencies
5. Configure environment
6. Deploy application
7. Hope it works
```

#### Docker Way:
```
1. Create Dockerfile
2. Build container image
3. Run container
4. Done!
```

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'healthy', uptime: process.uptime() });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

#### Step 4: Create Dockerfile
```dockerfile
