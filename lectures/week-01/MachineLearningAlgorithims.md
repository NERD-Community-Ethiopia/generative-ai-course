## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) is a core subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. This guide introduces the main categories and most widely used ML algorithms, helping learners choose the right one for specific tasks.

## 1. What is Machine Learning?

* **Definition**: Machine Learning involves statistical algorithms that learn from data and generalize to unseen data, enabling systems to perform tasks without explicit programming.
* **Recent Advancements**: Driven heavily by developments in neural networks and deep learning.
* **Goal of ML**: Understand key ML algorithms and learn how to choose the best algorithm based on a problem's nature.

## 2. Main Subfields of Machine Learning

* **Supervised Learning**: Learns from labeled data where the output is known.
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Works with unlabeled data to find patterns or structures.

## 3. Supervised Learning

* **Concept**: Trains algorithms using input-output pairs.
* **Examples**:

  * Predict house prices using square footage and location.
  * Classify animals as cats or dogs using physical traits.
* **Analogy**: Like teaching a child the difference between cats and dogs by showing labeled examples.
* **Goal**: Find a function that maps inputs to outputs.

### Subcategories:

* **Regression**:

  * Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).
* **Classification**:

  * Assigns discrete labels (e.g., spam vs. no spam).

## 4. Key Supervised Learning Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression

* **Purpose**: Finds a linear relationship between variables.
* **Mechanism**: Minimizes error between predicted and actual values.
* **Example**: Predicting height based on shoe size.

### 2. Logistic Regression

* **Purpose**: Classifies data using probability.
* **Mechanism**: Uses a sigmoid function to output probabilities.
* **Example**: Predicting gender from height and weight.

### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* **Purpose**: Classifies/regresses based on proximity in feature space.
* **Mechanism**: Averages or finds majority label among K nearest data points.
* **Note**: Selecting K is crucial (small K overfits, large K underfits).

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* **Purpose**: Separates classes with the widest possible margin.
* **Mechanism**: Uses support vectors to define decision boundaries.
* **Extensions**: Kernels allow non-linear decision boundaries.

### 5. Naive Bayes

* **Purpose**: Classifies based on probabilities.
* **Mechanism**: Applies Bayes’ Theorem assuming independence between features.
* **Use Case**: Email spam filtering.

### 6. Decision Trees

* **Purpose**: Uses a flowchart of decisions.
* **Mechanism**: Asks yes/no questions to segment data.
* **Goal**: Achieve pure leaf nodes with minimal misclassification.

## 5. Ensemble Methods (Decision Tree-Based)

### 1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

* **Purpose**: Improves stability and accuracy.
* **Mechanism**: Trains on random subsets of data.
* **Example**: Random Forests – multiple trees vote on the output.

### 2. Boosting

* **Purpose**: Builds a strong model from a sequence of weak models.
* **Mechanism**: Each model corrects the mistakes of the previous.
* **Examples**: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.

## 6. Neural Networks

* **Challenge**: Traditional models struggle with complex inputs (e.g., images).
* **Solution**: Neural networks with hidden layers perform automatic feature engineering.
* **Structure**:

  * Input Layer → Hidden Layers → Output Layer
* **Deep Learning**: Neural networks with multiple hidden layers.
* **Application**: Face recognition, natural language processing.

---

## 7. Unsupervised Learning

* **Concept**: No output labels; algorithm discovers patterns.
* **Analogy**: Giving a kid animal pictures and asking them to group them.
* **Use Cases**: Data exploration, anomaly detection, customer segmentation.

## 8. Key Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

### 1. Clustering

* **Goal**: Identify inherent groupings in data.
* **K-Means**:

  * Chooses K cluster centers.
  * Assigns points to nearest center.
  * Recalculates centers and repeats.
* **Alternatives**:

  * Hierarchical Clustering
  * DBScan (for arbitrary-shaped clusters)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

* **Goal**: Reduce features while preserving information.
* **Use Cases**: Preprocessing, visualization, reducing overfitting.
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:

  * Identifies directions (Principal Components) that capture most variance.
  * Reduces redundant data.

## 9. Choosing the Right Algorithm

* **Depends On**:

  * Nature of problem (classification, regression, clustering)
  * Size and type of dataset
  * Model interpretability
* **Tuning**:

  * Hyperparameters like K in KNN/K-Means require experimentation.
  * Cross-validation helps choose optimal parameters.
* **Tools**: Use Scikit-learn cheat sheets and libraries for model selection.

## 10. Summary

* **Supervised Learning**: Regression, classification using labeled data.
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
* **Algorithms Covered**:

  * Linear & Logistic Regression
  * KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees
