# Week 1 Submission - Efrata 

## Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.8+ installed
- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] API keys configured

## Completed Exercises
- [x] Simple AI Agent
- [x] Interactive Chat Agent
- [x] Specialized Code Review Agent

## Challenges Faced
I faced challenges while:
- Setting up the environment and installing all required packages, especially since this was an initial task.
- Getting familiar with the text editor and GitHub environment after a long time of not using Git.

## Learning Outcomes
From this workshop, I learned how to:
- Use Git for version control, including creating branches and managing commits.
- Configure and use API keys securely using environment variables.
- Work with AI agents using LangChain and OpenAI.
- Set up a development environment and install necessary Python packages.
## Next Steps
I would like to explore:
- Training this AI agent on a deeper level.
- Customizing the agent's behavior using different models and prompts.
- Integrating additional functionalities like memory and tools into the agent.
