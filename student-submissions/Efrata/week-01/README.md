## Description
This assignment implements a basic sentiment analysis tool using the `TextBlob` library. The AI reads user input and classifies it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on polarity. This helps demonstrate how simple natural language processing (NLP) tasks can be performed with lightweight tools in Python.

## Files Added/Modified
- `student-submissions/Efrata/week-01/README.md`
- `student-submissions/Efrata/week-01/assignment.py`

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to use the `TextBlob` library for sentiment analysis.
- Practiced building a command-line interface (CLI) loop to simulate conversation with the AI.
- learned how to use git

### Challenges Faced:
- Initially, `TextBlob` didnâ€™t work properly due to missing corpora files.
- Solved the issue by running `python -m textblob.download_corpora`.
