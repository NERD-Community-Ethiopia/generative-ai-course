# Week 1 Submission - [Eyoel Alemayehu]

## Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.8+ installed
- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] API keys configured

## Completed Exercises
- [x] Simple AI Agent
- [x] Interactive Chat Agent
- [x] Specialized Code Review Agent

## Challenges Faced
## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- At first, I forgot to activate the virtual environment, so the code kept saying that `langchain` and `openai` were missing. I didn’t know what was wrong until I realized I had to run `venv\Scripts\activate` first.

- I also didn’t know that I needed a `.env` file for the API keys. When I ran the code, it gave me errors about missing API keys. I had to search online to figure out how to create the `.env` file and use `load_dotenv()` in Python.

- When I tried running the interactive agent, it kept crashing because I typed empty inputs or random stuff. I added a check to skip empty messages and that fixed it.

- Git was confusing at first . I didn’t understand branches and made a few mistakes pushing to the wrong branch. But after a few tries I learned how to use `git checkout -b` and `git push origin branch-name`.

- I also wasn’t sure where to put the files at first. I kept putting the `.py` files in the wrong folder until I re-read the submission guide and fixed the folder structure.



## Learning Outcomes
- i learned how to set up a virtual environment
- i learned how to use git
- i learned how to use github
- i learned how to use ai as a tool and it helped me add a whole another level to my productivity
- i learned how to use the terminal in vs code by learning the linux commands

## Next Steps
- i would really like to deep dive about to ai agents how to use them and how to use n8n
