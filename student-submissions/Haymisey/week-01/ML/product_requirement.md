# Product Requirement Document: Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification

## üéØ Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The goal is to classify breast tumors as either **malignant** (cancerous) or **benign** (non-cancerous) using features derived from medical imaging of breast tissue samples. This is a **binary classification problem**, where the task is to predict the tumor class based on numerical attributes describing cell characteristics.

### Objective
Build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to accurately distinguish between malignant and benign tumors using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

## üìä Dataset Information

### Source
- **Dataset**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- **URL**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
- **License**: Public Domain

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: 569 instances (samples)
- **Features**: 30 numerical attributes
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (Malignant/Benign)
- **Missing Values**: None
- **Data Quality**: High quality, well-documented medical data

### Feature Description
The dataset contains 30 features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image:

1. **Mean Values** (10 features): radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension
2. **Standard Error Values** (10 features): same as above
3. **Worst Values** (10 features): same as above
