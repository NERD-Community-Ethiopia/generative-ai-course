## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
Throughout this week, I encountered and overcame several challenges:

- **API Integration**:  
  I initially struggled with integrating the OpenAI API correctly. This was resolved by thoroughly reviewing the official documentation and experimenting with example code.

- **Dependency Issues**:  
  I faced errors due to incompatible or missing packages. I resolved these by ensuring all dependencies were correctly installed and compatible with my Python version.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
This week helped me strengthen my skills in:

- Setting up and managing Python virtual environments  
- Building AI agents using OpenAI's API  
- Managing conversational memory in interactive agents  

## 🚀 Next Steps
To continue progressing, I plan to:

- Explore advanced OpenAI API capabilities, such as model fine-tuning  
- Build more advanced agents with multi-turn conversation handling  
- Integrate data retrieval and processing features into my agents
