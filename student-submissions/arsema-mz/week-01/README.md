# Week 1 Submission - Arsema Mandefro

## Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.8+ installed
- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] API keys configured

## Completed Exercises
- [x] Simple AI Agent
- [x] Interactive Chat Agent
- [x] Specialized Code Review Agent

## Challenges Faced
I encountered several challenges throughout this week:
- **Understanding API integration**: Initially, I struggled with how to correctly integrate the OpenAI API. I resolved this by reviewing the official documentation and experimenting with sample code.
- **Debugging errors**: I faced several errors related to dependency installations. This was solved by ensuring all packages were compatible and up to date.

## Learning Outcomes
This workshop significantly enhanced my understanding of:
- How to set up and configure a virtual environment.
- The process of building a basic AI agent using OpenAI's API.
- Techniques for managing conversation state in interactive agents.

## Next Steps
Moving forward, I plan to explore:
- Advanced features of the OpenAI API, including fine-tuning models.
- Building more complex agents that can handle multi-turn conversations effectively.
- Integrating additional functionalities, such as data retrieval and processing.
