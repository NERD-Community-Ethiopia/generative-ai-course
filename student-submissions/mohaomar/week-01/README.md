## Challenges Faced  
I encountered an issue with my OpenAI API and couldn't access it at all.  
Eventually, I resolved it by switching to **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, and everything is now set up and working effectively.

## Learning Outcomes  
I learned a lot, including how to integrate a few lines of Python code with LLM models to create my own wrapper.  
It was fun and creative, even though we didn’t go very deep.

## Next Steps  
I hope to continue learning at a deeper level and build more efficient models and personal projects.
